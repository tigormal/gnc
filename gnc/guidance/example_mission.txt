## --------------------
## Advanced stuff

# Set units for shifts as meter, coordinates as n-vector
UNITS "m"  # <- mil, km, nm, etc.
COORDS "n-vector"  # <- lla, direct

# Plan route to coordinates 0.0 10.0 (given in WKT format)
TARGET "POINT (0.0 10.0)"

# Start moving in helix building map, maximum radius 10 m from start
DISCOVERY, DISTANCE 10

		COMMAND Flashlight
	ON VISUAL tank_bot:
		TARGET VISUAL
		COMMAND Unload
	ON TELEMETRY (battery <= 20):
		EXIT  # Exit discovery
	ON TELEMETRY (damage == "HIGH"):
		EXIT

REPEAT TIMES 5:
	TARGET "Main / Home" + Z25, APPROACH
	COMMAND Load
	TARGET "Main / Warehouse" + Z10.0 - X0.2, APPROACH
	COMMAND Unload
	ON VISUAL human:
		ABORT
	ON TELEMETRY (battery <= 20):
		TARGET "Main / Home" + Z25, APPROACH

REPEAT UNTIL TELEMETRY (battery <= 5):
	FOLLOW "Routes / Circle 1"
